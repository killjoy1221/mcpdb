# mcpdb

A database for mcp accessible via REST

## Configuration

See `config.py` for an example configuration and defaults.

## API Usage

Full API documentation is located at `/api` and generated by swagger.

### Authentication

1. Make a `POST` request to `/api/login` with a json payload object containing
    `username` and `password` fields. This will return an empty response with
    status `204` if it was successful.

    a. The header will contain the `Authorization` key. This is your token and
        is needed for all login required api endpoints.

    b. The header will also contain the `Expires` key. This tells you when the
        token will expire.
        
2. For all future requests, supply the `Authorization` header.

### Full Example

**Python + Requests**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import getpass
import requests

url = "https://mcpdb.myapplication.com"

# Headers for later use
headers = {}

# Obtain username/password from user
username = input("Username: ")
password = getpass.getpass()

# Authorize and get the login token
auth_data = dict(username=username, password=password)
with requests.post(url + "/api/login", json=auth_data) as resp:
    resp.raise_for_status()
    # Successfully logged in, set the header for later
    headers['Authorization'] = resp.headers['Authorization']

# Get the names to set from user.
srg_name = input("SRG Name: ")
new_name = input("New Name: ")

# Now i can set the names how I like.
set_data = dict(mcpname=new_name)
with requests.put(url + '/api/field/' + srg_name, json=set_data, headers=headers) :
    print("Status: " + str(resp.status_code))
    data = resp.json()
    # Print out the server response
    for k, v in data.items():
        print(k + ": " + str(v))
```
